Professionally, I've worked in technology since 1998 serving a variety of roles, from desktop support (ages ago) to SRE work. 

I currently work at PLXIS, building system infrastructure on a small team of extremely talented engineers who are dedicated to the craft. This is an incredible place to work, and I have not once dreaded a Monday since I started here... YES we are [hiring](https://www.plxis.com/#careers) Or you can contact me directly.  If that changes, or if my career compass changes, I'll update this page with a resume/cv or whatever. Until [then...](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luiscerezo/)


Personally, I love photography, design, coffee, and ... something.

There are links at the bottom for the normal social media things. Follow me there if you really want to know more.
